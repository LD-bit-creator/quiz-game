Quiz Game Project ðŸŽ¯
This project is a Python-based Quiz Game designed to demonstrate and practice core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The game presents users with a series of questions and keeps track of their scores, offering an engaging way to test knowledge on various topics.

Features
Encapsulation: All game functionalities such as question handling, score tracking, and user interaction are encapsulated within dedicated classes.
Inheritance: Different types of questions (e.g., multiple-choice, true/false) inherit from a base Question class, promoting code reuse and organization.
Polymorphism: Methods are overridden in derived classes to implement specific behaviors for different question types.
Abstraction: Complex operations are hidden behind simple interfaces, providing a seamless and user-friendly gaming experience.
Extensibility: The modular design allows for easy addition of new question types and categories.
Interactive CLI: The game features an interactive command-line interface that guides users through the quiz smoothly.
Purpose
This project serves as a practical example for understanding and applying OOP principles in Python. It's suitable for beginners learning Python OOP concepts and for developers looking to implement structured and maintainable code in their projects
